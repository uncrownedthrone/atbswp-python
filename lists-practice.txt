1. What is []?
a list

2. How would you assign the value 'hello' as the third value in a list stored in a variable named spam? (Assume spam contains [2, 4, 6, 8, 10].)
spam.insert(3, 'hello')

For the following three questions, spam contains the list ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd'].
3. What does spam[int(int('3' * 2) // 11)] evaluate to?
d (index 3)
'3' * 2 evaluates to '33'
int('33') evaluates to 33
33 // 11 evaluates to 3
spam[int(3)] returns index 3, d

4. What does spam[-1] evaluate to?
'd'
-1 is the last index in the list

5. What does spam[:2] evaluate to?
['a', 'b']

For the following three questions, let’s say bacon contains the list [3.14, 'cat', 11, 'cat', True].
6. What does bacon.index('cat') evaluate to?
1

7. What does bacon.append(99) make the list value in bacon look like?
[3.14, 'cat', 11, 'cat', True, 99]

8. What does bacon.remove('cat') make the list value in bacon look like?
[3.14, 11, 'cat', True, 99]

9. What are the operators for list concatenation and list replication?
+ and *

10. What is the difference between the append() and insert() list methods?
append() adds the item to the end of the list
insert() adds the item where you specify insert(item, position)

11. What are two ways to remove values from a list?
remove() and del

12. Name a few ways that list values are similar to string values.
a string is similar to a list of individual letters making up a word
they're both in an ordered sequence

13. What is the difference between lists and tuples?
lists are mutable and tuples are not

14. How do you type the tuple value that has just the integer value 42 in it?
value(42,)

15. How can you get the tuple form of a list value? How can you get the list form of a tuple value?
to get a tuple: tuple(['cat', 'dog', 5]) returns ('cat', 'dog', 5)
to get a list : list(('cat', 'dog', 5)) returns ['cat','dog', 5]

16. Variables that “contain” list values don’t actually contain lists directly. What do they contain
instead?
they contain a copy of the reference to the item in the list and use it for the parameter

17. What is the difference between copy.copy() and copy.deepcopy()?
copy.copy() will create a duplicate of a list or dictionary
copy.deepcopy() will do the same but is used when there are lists within lists

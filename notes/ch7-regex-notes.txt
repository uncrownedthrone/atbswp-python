regex module = import re

re.compile()
    returns a regex pattern object/regex object

re.search()
    searches the string it's passed for any matches to the regex
    will return None if it's not found in the string
    will return Match object, which have a group() method that will return the actual
    matched text form the searched string

    use re.complile() to define the regex you want to search with
    use spam.search() to pass it the string you want to search
    use spam.group() to return the matched text if there is any

grouping with ()
    creates groups within the regex that you can call on individually
    passing 0 or nothing will return the entire group

    phoneNumRegex = re.compile(r'(\d\d\d)-(\d\d\d-\d\d\d\d)')
    mo = phoneNumRegex.search('My number is 415-555-4242')
    mo.group(1)
        '415'
    mo.group(2)
        '555-4242'

    to grab all groups, use groups() <-- see plural. returns a tuple
    remember you can use the multiple assignment trick as well

ensure the use of escape characters since you're using raw strings
    not .   ^   $   *   +   ?   {   }   [   ]   \   |   (   )
    use \.  \^  \$  \*  \+  \?  \{  \}  \[  \]  \\  \|  \(  \)

match multiple groups with pipe
    only the first occurrence is returned
    findall() to find all of the matching occurrences

optional matching with ?
    will match zero or one instance
    ex. using it to optionally look for area codes

*  match zero or more
+  match one or more
{} match specific repetitions
